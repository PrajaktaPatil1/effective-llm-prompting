Effective Prompting for LLMs
Prompting is the simplest and fastest way to guide large language models (LLMs) toward generating the desired output , without modifying the model or needing extra infrastructure.

This project explores techniques for writing better prompts, comparing them to more advanced methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, and demonstrating that in many cases, a well-crafted prompt is all you need.

 Why Prompting Matters
While advanced techniques like RAG and fine-tuning offer deeper control, prompting remains the first line of defense when solving real-world problems with LLMs:

 *No extra compute or cost

 *Instant experimentation

 *Easy iteration and debugging

 *Surprisingly effective when done right
